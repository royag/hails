Hails is intended to be a lightweight, rails-inspired, RAD MVC web framework for the Haxe-language.

The application is written in the Haxe-language, and it is then compiled into one of the three supported targets: PHP, Java (Servlet) or Neko.

Supported databases are Sqlite (all targets), MySQL (all targets) and Microsoft SQL Server (Java target only).

Note that Hails is in a alpha-state, and is not production-ready for the public.
The core-code is also quite old and messy and needs some cleaning up as well as some tests.

Getting started with a simple database-enabled web application however, on any of the three targets, is very easy:
